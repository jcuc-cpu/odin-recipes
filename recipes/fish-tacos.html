    <h2>Tilapia Fish Tacos with Pineapple</h2>
    <p>Since moving to California nearly 10 years ago, I am fairly confident that I have eaten my weight in fish tacos several times over. There are just so many variations—I have to try them all, right?!</p>
    <p>I've had tacos with halibut, snapper, and even salmon. I've enjoyed tacos with deep-fried fish and tacos with grilled fish. I've sampled tacos with tongue-tingling tingling mayo and tacos with tangy fruit salsa. I've had tacos at fancy San Francisco restaurants with white tablecloths and tacos from open air taquerias overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p>But there really is only one kind of fish taco that I routinely make myself at home: these easy pan-seared fish tacos with citrusy mayo and a simple cabbage slaw. They're ready in about 20 minutes and they hit the spot every time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound cod, tilapia, halibut, or other white fish filets</li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoons chili powder, enough to coat the fish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 Celery stalk, chopped</li>
        <li>3 to 4 tablespoons lime juice (from 2 limes)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, lime juice, and hot sauce (if using) for the taco sauce. Stir until combined.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the shredded cabbage with 3 tablespoons of the taco sauce. Stir to coat and add more taco sauce if you like. (The cabbage shouldn't be dripping with sauce; aim for a very thin coating.)</li>
        <li>In a dry skillet over medium-high heat, warm the tortillas one at a time for about 30 seconds on both sides. Alternatively, wrap 1 to 3 tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds, until warm.</li>
        <li>Keep warmed tortillas wrapped in a clean dish towel while you make the fish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the fish on both sides with chili powder and salt. Gently rub in the seasonings with your fingers to make sure the fish is entirely coated.</li>
        <li>Warm a large cast iron or nonstick skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat. When hot, add one tablespoon of olive oil and tilt the pan to entirely coat the bottom.</li>
    </ol>
