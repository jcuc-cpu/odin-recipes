    <h2>Pabellón Criollo</h2>
    <p>Pabellón Criollo is the Venezuelan national dish and is without a doubt my family’s favorite. I must confess, I don't prepare is as often as I would like, but every time I do it's a huge success! Looking at the recipe you might think this dish is a little complicated, but it doesn't have to be. For example, the meat can be cooked and shredded the day before. I use canned beans, something my mom disapproves of, but it saves me tons of time. Serve the pabellón with arepitas and cream, it's delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 kg Beef skirt</li>
        <li>2 liters Water</li>
        <li>1 Onion cut in quarters</li>
        <li>1 peeled and chopped Carrot</li>
        <li>2 Sweet ají cut in half or ½ bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 Celery stalk, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch of Coriander</li>
        <li>1 bunch of Parsley</li>
        <li>Salt to your liking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the meat in a pot.</li>
        <li>Add the pieces of onion, carrot, celery (celery), the chopped peppers and the bunches of cilantro and parsley.</li>
        <li>Cover with water, cover the pot and cook for an hour and a half over medium heat. If you have a pressure cooker, cook for about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the pot and let it rest for about 5 minutes before shredding it. With the help of two forks, shred the still hot meat into thin and long strands.</li>
        <li>In a frying pan, brown the onion and garlic cut into brunoises in olive oil until they are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add cumin, curry, ground paprika and stir.</li>
        <li>Add a little of the meat broth.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded meat, the julienned bell peppers or sweet peppers and the chopped tomato, and mix all the ingredients. If you see that the meat is a bit dry, add more broth.</li>
        <li>Let cook covered and over low heat for about 15 minutes so that all the flavors mingle. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and chili flakes to taste.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to serve, adjust the seasonings to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
