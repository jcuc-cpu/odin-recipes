    <h2>Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken</h2>
    <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta: Of course, you’ll need fettuccine pasta.</li>
        <li>Butter: This Alfredo sauce starts with two sticks of butter.</li>
        <li>Cream: The rich sauce calls for almost a cup of heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: The fettuccine Alfredo is simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.
        <li>Cheese: You’ll need Romano and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter and cream together on the stove, season, and stir in the cheese.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta in the cheese sauce.</li>
    </ol>
